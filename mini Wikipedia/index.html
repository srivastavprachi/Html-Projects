                        <strong>Marie Curie</strong> was born as <em>Maria Sklodowska</em> on <strong>November 7, 1867</strong>, in <em>Warsaw</em>, part of the Russian-controlled <em>Congress Kingdom of Poland</em>. She was the youngest of five children in a deeply intellectual and patriotic family. Her father was a teacher of mathematics and physics, and her mother was a respected headmistress who died from <strong>tuberculosis</strong> when Marie was just 10 years old — an early loss that deeply affected her.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        From childhood, Marie was noted for her <strong>prodigious memory</strong> and <strong>academic brilliance</strong>. At the age of 16, she completed her secondary education at the Russian lycée, earning a <strong>gold medal</strong> for academic excellence. However, her pursuit of higher education was hindered by <em>political restrictions</em> and <em>financial hardships</em>. Her father had lost most of the family’s savings due to poor investments, forcing young Marie to work as a teacher.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During this time, she also joined the nationalist <strong>“Flying University”</strong>, an underground educational initiative that offered secret classes in Polish, defying Russian efforts to suppress Polish culture and language. She actively read and taught <em>Polish literature</em> to women factory workers, showing early signs of her commitment to both <strong>intellectual freedom</strong> and <strong>social equality</strong>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the age of 18, she became a <em>governess</em> for a wealthy family in rural Poland. There, she suffered a painful and unfulfilled love affair with the landowner’s son — an experience that left a lasting emotional impact. Despite personal setbacks, she remained focused on her long-term goal: to <strong>study science in Paris</strong>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Demonstrating selflessness and foresight, Marie used her limited income to support her sister <strong>Bronisława's medical education</strong> in Paris, on the condition that Bronisława would one day help her do the same. This pact between sisters laid the foundation for Marie’s eventual journey to France, where her <em>scientific destiny</em> would unfold.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Her early years reflect a combination of <strong>hardship</strong>, <strong>intellectual determination</strong>, and <strong>unwavering courage</strong> — qualities that would come to define her extraordinary life and career.

                    Marie Curie's early education in <strong>Warsaw, Poland</strong> was shaped by her deep curiosity and a strong family emphasis on learning. Born in 1867, she was raised under the Russian Empire’s rule, which limited Polish access to higher education and barred women from universities. Despite these obstacles, she excelled in school, graduating at the top of her class from a Russian lycée at age sixteen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Determined to continue learning, she joined the <em>"Flying University"</em>, an underground educational network that taught Polish students — including women — in secret. There, she studied science, philosophy, and literature while also teaching poor children, showing early signs of her commitment to both education and social justice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to financial struggles, she worked as a <em>governess for several years</em>, continuing to study independently in her free time. Marie made an agreement with her sister Bronisława: she would help fund Bronisława’s medical studies in Paris, and Bronisława would later support Marie’s education in return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1891, Marie finally moved to <strong>Paris</strong> and enrolled at the <strong>Sorbonne (University of Paris)</strong>. She faced immense challenges — adjusting to a new language, surviving in poverty, and studying among a mostly male student body. Despite these hardships, she thrived. She earned a degree in <strong>physics in 1893</strong>, finishing first in her class, and a second degree in <strong>mathematics in 1894</strong>, ranking second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During her studies, she lived in <em>extreme austerity</em>, often sacrificing food and comfort to buy textbooks and continue her research. Her passion for learning remained unwavering. She soon met <strong>Pierre Curie</strong>, a fellow scientist, and they would later marry and collaborate on groundbreaking research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marie Curie’s education was not confined to lecture halls. It was a powerful combination of <em>self-study, determination, and academic excellence</em>. Her ability to overcome societal and financial barriers made her not only one of the first women to earn degrees in science from the Sorbonne but also a role model for future generations. Her journey remains a testament to the transformative power of education.

                    After completing her education, <strong>Marie Curie</strong> joined forces with <strong>Pierre Curie</strong>, her husband and scientific partner. Together, they began researching the mysterious phenomenon discovered by Henri Becquerel — the emission of rays from uranium salts. Marie coined the term <strong>“radioactivity”</strong> to describe this new form of energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1898, after painstaking experimentation and analysis, the Curies announced the discovery of a new radioactive element: <strong>polonium</strong>, named in honor of Marie’s homeland, <em>Poland</em>, which was under partition at the time. Later that same year, they discovered <strong>radium</strong>, another element with even stronger radioactive properties. These discoveries were revolutionary and earned them international recognition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marie Curie’s meticulous research involved processing tons of <em>pitchblende</em>, a uranium-rich ore, in order to isolate tiny amounts of radium chloride. This process required both chemical expertise and extraordinary patience. Her work was carried out in a makeshift shed with primitive tools, underscoring her commitment to science despite difficult conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The concept of <strong>radioactivity</strong>, which Marie helped define and explore, opened entirely new fields of study. She was the first to recognize that radiation was not the result of a chemical reaction but rather a property of the atom itself. This insight laid the foundation for <em>nuclear physics</em> and fundamentally changed our understanding of matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her discoveries had profound applications beyond theoretical science. The isolation of radium led to the development of early <strong>radiotherapy</strong> for treating cancer, establishing a new path in medical treatments. During World War I, Marie Curie applied her knowledge by helping develop <em>mobile X-ray units</em> to assist in battlefield surgeries, saving countless lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marie Curie's scientific discoveries were not only groundbreaking but also transformative. She conducted all her work with extreme rigor and integrity, refusing to patent the process of isolating radium so others could benefit freely. Her legacy in scientific exploration continues to influence modern physics, chemistry, and medicine, making her one of the most influential scientists in history.

                        <li><strong>Marie Curie's notebooks</strong> are still radioactive and are kept in special lead-lined boxes to this day. They remain a testament to her pioneering work in radioactivity and her groundbreaking discoveries.</li>
                        <li>Marie Curie named <em>polonium</em>, one of the radioactive elements she discovered, after her homeland, <strong>Poland</strong>, as a silent protest against the Russian occupation at the time.</li>
                        <li>She carried test tubes filled with <strong>radioactive materials</strong> in her pockets, unaware of the dangerous health risks associated with prolonged exposure to radiation.</li>
                        <li>Marie Curie was the first woman to <strong>win a Nobel Prize</strong>, and she is still the only person to have ever received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields—<em>Physics</em> and <em>Chemistry</em>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, who was a great admirer of Curie’s work, famously remarked that “Marie Curie is, of all celebrated beings, the only one whom fame has not corrupted.” He also supported her during times of public criticism.</li>
                        <li>Marie Curie’s achievements helped lay the groundwork for the development of <strong>radiotherapy</strong>, a revolutionary medical treatment used to fight cancer. Her discoveries have saved countless lives over the decades.</li>
                        <li>Despite her fame, Marie Curie remained modest throughout her life, often choosing to focus on her work rather than the recognition she received. She once said, "I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will derive more good than evil from new discoveries." </li>
                        <li>Marie Curie was also the first woman to <strong>become a professor at the University of Paris</strong>, making her an inspiration to future generations of female scientists in academia.</li>
                        <li>Curie faced major struggles in her personal life, including the tragic death of her husband, Pierre Curie, in a <strong>car accident</strong> in 1906. Despite this, she continued her scientific work with unwavering dedication, refusing to give up on her research.</li>
                        <li>In addition to her scientific work, Marie Curie was actively involved in the <strong>World War I effort</strong>, developing mobile x-ray units known as "Little Curies" to help diagnose soldiers on the battlefield. This was one of the many ways she applied her knowledge of radioactivity to practical, life-saving purposes.</li>
